# AI-Based-Predictive Maintenance for Equipment using Machine Learning

## ðŸ“Œ Overview

This repository contains a research-backed implementation of a **Predictive Maintenance (PdM) System** designed to minimize unplanned equipment downtimes and optimize asset performance. Using real-time sensor data and machine learning techniques, this system detects early signs of failure in equipmentâ€”specifically APU compressors used in metro trains.

## ðŸ§  Key Features

- Real-time monitoring of equipment health
- Integration of multiple sensors (temperature, pressure, vibration, acoustic, current)
- Preprocessing and cleaning of time-series sensor data
- Fault prediction using ML algorithms like SVM, Random Forest, and Logistic Regression
- Anomaly detection using K-Means Clustering and LSTM models
- NLP-powered preventive suggestions using GPT-2
- Alert system integrated with push notifications (Firebase/APNS)
- GUI for live alerts and user feedback

## ðŸ“Š Dataset

- **Total Instances:** 15,169,480
- **Sensor Types:** Pressure, Temperature, Motor Current, Oil Temperature, Voltage, etc.
- **Attributes:** 15 real-world parameters recorded every second
- **Period:** February to August 2020
- **Application:** APU compressor units in metro trains
